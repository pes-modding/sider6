<a class="top" href="#">Top</a>
<a name="intro">
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
</a>

<p>The main idea here is to provide a safe and flexible way to
extend Sider functionality. It allows modders to alter many
aspects of game logic, and load all sorts of extra content.
Visual and gameplay tweaks are possible too.</p>

<p>Instead of offering a C interface, where the programmers would need
to write a DLL, i'm a taking a different approach here and trying to
design a system, where extension modules are written in Lua. A module
would typically initialize itself by registering for certain events,
and then Sider will call the module functions, when those events
occur later in the game.</p>

<p>Lua is by now a well-established language of choice for scripting
support in games, used all over the gaming industry. Most famous
example is probably WarCraft, but many modern games use it, including
Pro Evolution Soccer itself.
To boost the performance, Sider uses a just-in-time compiler for Lua
called LuaJIT (<a href="https://luajit.org">https://luajit.org</a>), written
by Mike Pall. LuaJIT is a truly brilliant piece
of software. It is 100% compatible with Lua 5.1, and it is super fast,
often approaching and sometimes exceeding the speed of C code.</p>

<p>After reading this guide, the next step is to study the example (and
non-example) modules, which are provided with this release of Sider.
Find them in the "modules" directory.</p>

<a class="top" href="#">Top</a>
<a name="module">
<h3>2. Module structure</h3>
</a>

<p>If you are familiar with Lua and how modules are typically organized
then this will make full sense to you. If are you new to Lua, i would
strongly recommend reading "Programming in Lua" by Roberto Ierusalimschy.
2nd edition covers Lua 5.1, which is the version of the language used
by Sider. However, any other edition of the book will be just as helpful.</p>

<p>In any case, the module organization is pretty simple:
<ol>
<li>Your need to create a new table</li>
<li>Provide a function, called "<b>init</b>" in that table, where you need to
do any initialization logic for the module and register for the events
your module is interested in.</li>
<li>Return that table as the last statement</li>
</ol>

<b>Example module: test.lua</b>

<pre>
local m = {}

function m.init(ctx)
    log("Hello, world!")
end

return m
</pre>

<p>As you have already guessed, this module doesn't really do much. But it
is a valid module, and can be loaded by Sider. For that you need to save
it as <i>{something}.lua</i> file in the "modules" folder, inside sider. Let's
assume that you named it: <span class="file">test.lua</span>. Then, you must also enable it in
<span class="file">sider.ini</span>, like this:</p>

<pre>
lua.module = "test.lua"
</pre>

<p>If you now run the game, your module will get loaded by Sider, and then
the "init" function will be called, so you should see a "Hello, world!"
message in <span class="file">sider.log</span>.
If you made a mistake and your module has a syntax error, for example,
or some other problem, don't panic, instead open <span class="file">sider.log</span> with Notepad
(or any text editor) and look for an error message there. It will explain
where (on which line of your script) and what sort of problem occurred.</p>

<p class="note">
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:<br />
File encoding <b>must be UTF-8</b>. This is vital, if you are
using non-latin characters in the strings in the module code - for example,
in paths. If you only have latin-1 chars, then ANSI is ok too.
</p>

<p>Let's now see how you can make a more useful module. First step for that
is to understand the context object (ctx).</p>


<a class="top" href="#">Top</a>
<a name="context">
<h3>3. Context object</h3>
</a>

<p>Context object is what Sider knows about the current state
of the game. As more scripts/modules are created by the community
the context object will probably also change, and include more and more
information about the game.</p>

<p>As of 6.3.0 release, the context object has the following:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th>ctx.home_team</th>
<td>id of the home team of the current match, after
it is selected in the exhibition match, or the next
match is determined in the league mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.away_team</th>
<td>id of the away team of the current match, after
it is selected in the exhibition match, or the next
match is determined in the league mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.tournament_id</th>
<td>numeric id of the current tournament. See
doc/tournament.txt file for the list
of ids for all of the game's tournaments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.match_id</th>
<td>some sort of number, which seems to indicate where
in the season you currently are. However, the exact
meaning of this id is unclear. Maybe you can figure
it out and tell me ;-)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.match_leg</th>
<td>set to 1 or 2, if this is 1st leg or 2nd leg of
a two-legged knock-out match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.match_info</th>
<td>meaning of this field varies, depending on the type of tournament:
<ul>
<li>league: number of league matches already played</li>
<li>cup/play-off:<br />
<ul>
<li>46 - first round of play-off,</li>
<li>47 - second round of play-off,</li>
<li>51 - quaterfinal,</li>
<li>52 - semifinal,</li>
<li>53 - final</li>
</ul>
</li>
You can use this together with ctx.tournament_id to
identify a final match of a particular tournament.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.stadium</td>
<td>numeric id of the stadium that will be used (or was
last used, if the stadium for the next match hasn't
been chosen yet by the game logic)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.stadium_choice</th>
<td>This field is set when the game is in one of the
exhibition modes, and the stadium is allowed to
be selected via the menu. Once the actual final
selection of the stadium is made (right after the
"<b>set_stadium</b>" event fires), the "stadium_choice"
field get removed from the context.<br /><br />
Special values:
<ul>
<li>65533 - home stadium</li>
<li>65534 - random stadium</li>
<li>65535 - not chosen yet</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.timeofday</th>
<td>The values are: 0 - day, 1 - night. Same as with
stadium, it represents the time of day of the coming
match, or the last one, if the stadium isn't set yet
for the next match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.season</th>
<td>The values are: 0 - summer, 1 - winter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.weather</th>
<td>The values are: 0 - fine, 1 - rainy, 2 - snowy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.weather_effects</th>
<td>The known values are:
<ul>
<li>2 - enforce weather effects (rain/snow falling)</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.match_time</th>
<td>Duration of the match in minutes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.difficulty</th>
<td>Difficulty that was chosen: 0 - Beginner, 1 - Amateur, ...  5 - All-star, 6 - Legend</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.extra_time</th>
<td>0/1 flag to indicate if extra time will be played</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.penalties</th>
<td>0/1 flag to indicate if penalty shootout will be played</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.substitutions</th>
<td>number of substitutions allowed in normal time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ctx.substitutions_in_extra_time</th>
<td>number of substitutions allowed in extra time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="last">ctx.kits</th>
<td class="last">table of functions for kit manipulation. (See more details further down)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The context object also contains a register function, which has the
following signature:

<p class="func">
ctx.register(event_name, handler_function)
</p>

<p>The event_name parameter is a string, which identifies a particular
event. The handler_function should be a function in your Lua module,
which will be called when the corresponding event happens. Parameters
vary depending on the event - see the next section for details on all
supported events and their handler signatures</p>

<p>The idea of the context object is that in your handler functions, your
code will make decisions on what to do, using the information in the
context.</p>


<h3>3.1. ctx.kits</h3>

<p>It is a table of helper functions to manipulate kits (uniforms).</p>

<p class="warn">IMPORTANT NOTE:<br />
kit operations only work for "licensed" teams, in other
words, for those that have real kits, not ones made in game editor.
If your team is unlicensed, use <b>Kit Studio</b> or <b>Team Licencer</b>
from SimpleTools collection (both tools by <span class="user">zlac</span>) to convert it
to a licensed team.</p>

<p>The table contains the following functions:</p>

<p class="func">
ctx.kits.get_current_team(home_or_away)
</p>

<p class="desc">Returns the team id for the currently chosen home or away team -
depending on the parameter that you pass in:
<ul>
<li>0 - home team</li>
<li>1 - away team</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="func">
ctx.kits.get_current_kit_id(home_or_away)
</p>

<p class="desc">Returns the currently chosen player kit_id for home or away team -
depending on the parameter that you pass in:
<ul>
<li>0 - home team</li>
<li>1 - away team</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="func">
ctx.kits.get(team_id, kit_id)
</p>

<p class="desc">Returns a table of attributes for a player kit for specified team
and kit_id. The kit_id can range from 0 to 9. The returned table
contains all attributes for the requested kit - things like:
<span class="kitattr">Collar</span>,
<span class="kitattr">KitModel</span>,
<span class="kitattr">KitFile</span>,
<span class="kitattr">BackNumbersFile</span>, and so for. We call
this collection of attributes a "kit config".</p>

<p class="func">
ctx.kits.set(team_id, kit_id, kit_cfg, home_or_away)
</p>

<p class="desc">Sets the kit attributes to the values provided in kit_cfg table,
for the chosen team and kit. The last parameter is optional: if
you specify it, then use 0 - for home team, 1 - for away team,
and sider will update parts of team info in memory that control
the color of radar. This allows for correct radar colors, and
also for proper color-matching, when kits are initially chosen
by the game logic, in such a way that they don't clash.</p>

<p class="func">
ctx.kits.get_gk(team_id)
</p>

<p class="desc">Returns a table of attributes for a goalkeeper kit for specified team
The returned table contains all attributes for the kit, like it is
with a player kit.</p>

<p class="func">
ctx.kits.set_gk(team_id, kit_cfg)
</p>

<p class="desc">Sets the kit attributes to the values provided in kit_cfg table,
for the chosen team and goalkeeper kit.</p>

<p class="func">
ctx.kits.refresh(home_or_away)
</p>

<p class="desc">Forces a refresh of the kit for either home or away team -
depending on the value of the parameter:
<ul>
<li>0 - home team</li>
<li>1 - away team</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a class="top" href="#">Top</a>
<a name="events">
<h3>4. Supported events</h3>
</a>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"livecpk_make_key"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, filename)</span><br />
Return value is expected to be a <span class="file">string</span> or <span class="file">nil</span>.
</p>

<p>This event occurs when the game needs to find out some information
about the file, specified by relative filename. Maybe the game needs
to create a buffer, or it needs to determine the filesize, or something
else. Your handler function is expected to return a string key that
will be used for caching of "livecpk_get_filepath". You can just
return filename as the key, without any changes, or return nil -
which will result in the same outcome. But sometimes, you need to make
a different key, because the context has some additional information
that is important.</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"livecpk_get_filepath"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, filename, key)</span><br />
Return value is expected to be a <span class="file">string</span> or <span class="file">nil</span>.
</p>

<p>This event is related to "livecpk_make_key".
It works like this: after the key is returned by livecpk_make_key
handler, sider needs to know which actual file (absolute path) needs
to be loaded for this key. So your handler function is expected to
return a full absolute filename. Sider will cache this absolute filename
using the key returned by livecpk_make_key, and the next time this file
is needed, the livecpk_get_filepath event will NOT fire. (This is
again done for performance reasons so that we don't unnecessarily seek
the disk).</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"livecpk_rewrite"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, filename)</span><br />
Return value is expected to be a <span class="file">string</span> or <span class="file">nil</span>.
</p>

<p>Allows the filename to be rewritten to another. This is a very
powerful, but also quite dangerous function, if you are not careful.
If you rewrite the filename to something that does not exist in
LiveCPK roots or in download/data CPKs, and none of your modules
provide the content, then the game will be unable to load the file,
which can lead to different behaviours, depending on type of file being
loaded. If it's a DDS texture, then usually nothing bad happens -
you just get a white texture. But if it is a model file - you will
get an endless loop, where loading indicator will keep spinning
forever, or the game can just crash. So, be careful,
and don't rewrite blindly ;-)</p>

<p>See "kitrewrite.lua" module for an example of rewrite usage: it is
loading a 2nd player kit instead of a 1st goalkeeper kit, so your
goalkeepers end up wearing 2nd kit of outfield players.</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"livecpk_data_ready"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, filename, data, size, total_size, offset, cpk_filename)</span><br />
Return value: <span class="file">nil</span>.
</p>

<p>Provides a pointer to the buffer in memory that have just
been filled with data. Here is what the parameters mean:
<ul>
<li>ctx: context object</li>
<li>filename: the relative pathname of the file (For example, "common\pesdb\etc\Team.bin")</li>
<li>data: address of the buffer in memory where the data was loaded</li>
<li>size: buffer length in bytes</li>
<li>total_size: total size (in bytes) of the file</li>
<li>offset: offset in file before the read happened</li>
<li>cpk_filename: name of the CPK that the file was read from (if known)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>See <span class="file">filedump.lua</span>,
<span class="file">tracer.lua</span> and
<span class="file">facedump.lua</span> modules for
example usage of this event. This is an advanced feature, which you
will need if you wanted to examine the data that the game is about
to use. Care must be taken to not leak memory. Also, be aware that some
large files are not read all-at-once. For instance, music from
BGM.awb is accessed in small chunks - typically 0x8000 bytes in size,
which is enough for continuous playback of the song. In such situation,
you can use <span class="func">offset</span> and <span class="func">total_size</span> parameters to check what part
of the file was read.</p>

<p>Another possible use for this event, is tracking of what is happening in the game.
For example, when match is paused, a particular JSON file is loaded, and then when
the match resumes, another JSON file is loaded by the game. You can track and use
that information in your Lua scripts to trigger some additional logic, for example,
to play a sound file, or do some other task</p>

<p>Here is an example module that uses <span class="evt">"livecpk_data_ready"</span> event
to log every file as it is loaded by the game:

<pre>
local m = {}

function m.data_ready(ctx, filename, data, size, total_size, offset, cpk_filename)
    log(filename)
end

function m.init(ctx)
    ctx.register("livecpk_data_ready", m.data_ready)
end

return m
</pre>
</p>


<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"set_teams"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, home_team, away_team)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span>
</p>

<p>This event fires after both home and away teams are determined -
either during the team selection in exhibition game, or when the next
match becomes known in a league or a cup mode (League, Master League,
UCL, Europa League, etc.)
The team ids are also set as "home_team" and "away_team" fields in
the context object so that they can be used later, if needed.</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"set_kits"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, home_kit_info, away_kit_info)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span> or table or two tables.
</p>

<p>This event fires when player kits are chosen for both home and away teams -
The "home_kit_info" and "away_kit_info" contain kit attributes for home and
away player kits respectively. The handler function can modify the kit attributes
at this point by returning tables - one for home team, another - for away team,
containing the changed attributes. (For more information on this, consult
the "Kitserver 2020" thread on EvoWeb forums)</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"set_home_team_for_kits"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, team_id, is_edit_mode)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span>.
</p>

<p>This event fires when a home team is selected for loading of kits which happens soon after.
The 3rd parameter (boolean) indicates whether we are in Edit Mode or not.</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"set_away_team_for_kits"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, team_id, is_edit_mode)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span>.
</p>

<p>This event fires when an away team is selected for loading of kits which happens soon after.
The 3rd parameter (boolean) indicates whether we are in Edit Mode or not.<br/>
(NOTE: the "is_edit_mode" is always false for this function, as there is always only a "Home" team
in Edit Mode.)</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"set_match_time"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, minutes)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span> or <span class="file">integer</span>
</p>

<p>This event occurs, when the game sets the mach duration. If your handler
function returns an integer, then this value will be used as the match
time in minutes. This way you can accelerate or slow down the matches
beyound the allowed 5-30 minute range. See matchtime.lua - for an example
of such script.</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"set_stadium_choice"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, stadium_id)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span> or <span class="file">stadium_id</span>
</p>

<p>This event fires, when the game prepares to display the stadium image
or when it is entering pre-game menus of non-exhibition modes. In addition
to the actual id of the stadium chosen, the "stadium_id" parameter may have
the following special values:
<ul>
<li>65533 : home stadium</li>
<li>65534 : random stadium</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You handler function can change it, if it returns an integer value instead of <span class="file">nil</span>.
This integer value can either be a stadium id, or one of the following special
values, mentioned above.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: the final stadium selection isn't actually made, until after the
"set_stadium" event. So, if you want to change the stadium, or see what
was eventually chosen as random/home stadium, then you will need to also register
for the "set_stadium" event.</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"set_stadium"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, options)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span> or number or table
</p>

<p>This event fires, when the stadium settings are chosen for the upcoming
match. The "options" parameter is a Lua table which contains the following
keys: "stadium", "timeofday", "weather", "weather_effects", "season".
Each of these has an integer value, as the game uses:
<ul>
<li>stadium: the id of the stadium</li>
<li>timeofday: 0 - day, 1 - night</li>
<li>weather: 0 - fine (sunny), 1 - rain, 2 - snow</li>
<li>weather_effects: 2 - enforce falling rain/snow, other values - unknown</li>
<li>season: 0 - summer, 1 - winter</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You handler function can either return <span class="file">nil</span>, which means that other modules
can receive the event and process it. Or, the handler can return an stadium
id - an integer - to switch the stadium to another one. Be careful though:
sider doesn't check for correctness of values, so if you switch to a
non-existent stadium, the game will probably crash or go into infinite
"loading" loop. For an example usage - see stadswitch.lua module.

( For backwards compatibility, returning a table like this:
<tt>{ stadium = <i>stadium-id</i> }</tt> is also supported. However, any other keys in
that table will be ignored. )

<p>To change weather, timeofday and season - use a different event, called:
"set_conditions", which is documented next.
</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"set_conditions"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, options)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span> or table
</p>

<p>This event fires, when the stadium settings are chosen for the upcoming
match. The "options" parameter is a Lua table which contains the following
keys: "stadium", "timeofday", "weather", "weather_effects", "season".
Each of these has an integer value, as the game uses:
<ul>
<li>stadium: id of the stadium</li>
<li>timeofday: 0 - day, 1 - night</li>
<li>weather: 0 - fine (sunny), 1 - rain</li>
<li>weather_effects: 2 - enforce rain falling, other values - unknown</li>
<li>season: 0 - summer, 1 - winter</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You handler function can either return <span class="file">nil</span>, which means that other modules
can receive the event and process it. Or, the handler can return a table
of options, which are either modified or not. Returning a table of options
stops further propagation of the event. You <b>cannot</b> change the stadium id -
for that use "set_stadium" event. But you can change any of the other
three settings: just assign them different values.
For an example usage - see <span class="file">stadswitch.lua</span> module.

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"set_match_settings"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, options)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span> or table
</p>

<p>This event fires, after the match settings had been chosen for the upcoming
match. The "options" parameter is a Lua table which contains the following
keys: "difficulty", "extra_time", "penalties", "substitutions", "substitutions_in_extra_time".
Each of these has an integer value, as the game uses:
<ul>
<li>difficulty: 0 - Beginner, 1 - Amateur, 2 - Regular, 3 - Professional,
    4 - Top Player, 5 - Super Star, 6 - Legend</li>
<li>extra_time: 0 - off, 1 - on</li>
<li>penalties: 0 - off, 1 - on</li>
<li>substitutions: number of subs allowed in normal time</li>
<li>substitutions_in_extra_time: number of subs allowed in extra time</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You handler function can either return <span class="file">nil</span>, which means that other modules
can receive the event and process it. Or, the handler can return a table

Event name: <span class="evt">"after_set_conditions"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span>
</p>

<p>This event fires after "set_conditions". It doesn't allow the handler
to change anything, but it does provide the context object so that the
modules can react in whatever way they want.</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"get_ball_name"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, ballname)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span> or string
</p>

<p>This event fires, when the game prepares to display the ball name.
Your handler function can change it, if it returns a string instead of nil.
The string needs to be in UTF-8 encoding to correctly render non-ASCII
characters.</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"get_stadium_name"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, stadium_name, stadium_id, schedule_entry)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span> or string
</p>

<p>This event fires, when the game prepares to display the stadium name.
You handler function can change it, if it returns a string instead of nil.
(The "stadium_id" parameter is provided to handler function only as additional
information - for which stadium the name is being read/modified)
The string needs to be in UTF-8 encoding to correctly render non-ASCII
characters.</p>

<p>The last parameter - <span class="func">schedule_entry</span> - is new in sider 6.3.4. It is set to
<span class="file">nil</span> in all usual scenarios where stadium name is chosen, except for the case when
a Master League screen shows a small fragment of the schedule (schedule bar) with
the 4 matches: 1 that just happened, and 3 in the future. This is new in PES 2020
Master League (was not there in PES 2019). In this use-case the "get_stadium_name" event fires for each of
those 4 matches, and the <span class="func">schedule_entry</span> parameter is a table that contains
information about the corresponding match as its keys:
<ul>
<li>tournament_id</li>
<li>match_info</li>
<li>home_team</li>
<li>away_team</li>
</ul>

Event name: <span class="evt">"trophy_rewrite"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, tournament_id)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span> or number
</p>

<p>This event fires before the game checks if trophy scenes need to be shown
before (and after) the match. This is a specialized event, and is probably
not very useful for modules other than "trophy.lua". The "trophy.lua"
uses to enforce trophy scenes from specific tournaments. This makes it
possible to have trophy celebrations for tournaments that do not have
them in the original game content. (See <span class="file">trophy.lua</span>, if you are really
interested in how this works)</p>

Event name: <span class="evt">"show"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span>

<p>This event fires right before the module takes control of the overlay, because
the overlay was toggled on, or control switched from another module.</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"hide"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span>

Return values (3) expected: string, string, table
</p>

<p>
<a href="cap4.jpg"><img src="cap4.jpg" width="100%"/></a>
</p>

<p>All return values can be <span class="file">nil</span>, and also the handler may return three or two,
or one, or not return anything at all.
<ul>
<li>1st return value: text to display</li>
<li>2nd return value: full filename of the image to display</li>
<li>3rd return value: table with layout options</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>When the overlay is on, and the current Lua module is in control of the
overlay, this event fires once for each frame that is displayed by the game engine
(So, normally - 60 times per second). The returned string is what will be
displayed by the overlay. The logic that generates this string should not be
too heavy: too much processing may affect the frame rate.
See examples in modules: <span class="file">overdemo.lua</span> and <span class="file">etrace.lua</span>
</p>

<p>The text and image are displayed side by side: text - on the left,
image - on the right. The layout options table allows to specify some
formatting for the image. The following ones are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li>"<b>image_width</b>" : sets the width of the image on screen</li>
<ul>
<li>values &gt; 1 will be interpreted as desired width in pixels</li>
<li>values &lt; 1 will be interpreted as fraction of the total screen width.</li>
</ul>
<li>"<b>image_height</b>": sets the height of the image on screen
<ul>
<li>values &gt; 1 will be interpreted as desired height in pixels</li>
<li>values &lt; 1 will be interpreted as fraction of the total screen height.</li>
</ul>
<li>"<b>image_aspect_ratio</b>": a floating point number (width/height).<br />
This option allows to enforce aspect ratio that is
different from the source image. This value is NOT
used if both <b>image_width</b> and <b>image_height</b> are specified.</li>
<li>"<b>image_hmargin</b>": whitespace margin in pixels to be placed to the left and to
the right of the image.</li>
<li>"<b>image_vmargin</b>": whitespace margin in pixels to be placed to the top and to
the bottom of the image.</li>
</ul>

<p>Final dimensions of the image on screen are calculated using two of the three
options: "image_width", "image_height", "image_aspect_ratio" - in this order
of priority. If only 1 (or none of the three) are specified, then a default
width of 0.1 of total screen width is assumed, and the original aspect ratio
of the image is used to calculate the height.</p>

<p>Transparency of overlay images can be controlled by <b>overlay.image-alpha-max</b>
settings in <span class="file">sider.ini</span>. This setting affects all modules and cannot be changed
at runtime. See <a href="readme.html">readme.html</a> for details on how this settings works.

Event name: <span class="evt">"key_down"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, vkey)</span><br />
Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span>
</p>

<p>When the overlay is on, and the current Lua module is in control of the
overlay, this event fires when user presses down any key on the keyboard. The
so-called "virtual key code" will be passed as the value of "vkey" parameter.
Your function can that take appropriate action, if it wants to react to
such key events. A combination of <span class="evt">"overlay_on"</span> and <span class="evt">"key_down"</span> events can
be used to build simple UIs in the overlay itself.
See example of such UI in <span class="file">camera.lua</span></p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"key_up"</span><br />
Handler function: <span class="func">f(ctx, vkey)</span><br />

</p>

<p>When the overlay is on, and the current Lua module is in control of the
overlay, this event fires when user releases a key on the keyboard. The
so-called "virtual key code" will be passed as the value of "vkey" parameter.
Your function can that take appropriate action, if it wants to react to
such key events. (Typically, you would want to handle this event, if your
module needs to avoid the standard "autorepeat" mechanism, where the
operating system repeats "key_down" events when the key is held down.
For <span class="evt">"key_up"</span> there is no autorepeat.)</p>

<p class="evthdr">
Event name: <span class="evt">"gamepad_input"</span><br />

Return value expected: <span class="file">nil</span>
</p>

<p>When the overlay is on, and the current Lua module is in control of the
overlay, this event fires when user presses or releases a button, or moves
a stick or d-pad of the game controller. (If you have multiple controllers
attached, only one will generate these input events). The "inputs" parameter
is always a table containing at least one, but possibly more than one mapping
of: input-name --&gt; input-value. The "input-name" is a symbolic name that
identifies the source of input: a button, stick, d-pad. See the following
table for all possible combinations:</p>

<p>
<table class="inputs" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>input</th><th>input-name</th><th class="right">input-values</th></tr>

<p>Best way to verify what names correspond to what buttons on your
controller, is to try the <span class="file">inputdemo.lua</span> from the modules folder.
It uses overlay to display the last 20 input events - both from
keyboard and from gamepad.</p>

<p>If your module is registered for <span class="evt">"key_down"</span> event, but not for the
<span class="evt">"gamepad_input"</span> event, then sider will automatically map gamepad events
into keyboard events, and emit those, for such gamepad events that are
defined in the "global input mapping" configuration - in <span class="file">gamepad.ini</span>.</p>

<p>If you do not want this automatic mapping, make sure to register for
the <span class="evt">"gamepad_input"</span> event in your module, and then do whatever is needed
with the inputs. (You may choose to completely ignore them too, if you
want. See example of that in <span class="file">camera.lua</span>)</p>

<p class="note">
IMPORTANT NOTE: Some events can fire multiple times for the same "action".
That is normal, it's just how the game works internally. Make sure your
module logic can handle such situations correctly.

<a name="logging">
<h3>5. Logging</h3>
</a>

<p>Sider provides a function called <span class="func">log</span>. This can be used to print
out any information you want into the <span class="file">sider.log</span> file.
You can use <span class="func">string.format</span> to format your message in a way similar
to what you would do with C printf:

<pre>
log(string.format("My value is: %0.5f", math.pi))
</pre>

In <span class="file">sider.log</span> it will appear with a module name prefix, like as:

<pre>
[<i>modulename</i>.lua] My value is: 3.14159
</pre>


<a class="top" href="#">Top</a>
<a name="env">
<h3>6. Module environment</h3>
</a>

<p>Each module runs in its own environment. For detailed explanation
on what an environment is - read about Lua environments in the Lua
manual online, or in Programming in Lua book. What is important
here is that a module has access to a limited set of globals:</p>

<p>
standard Lua provides:<br />
<span class="func">assert, ipairs, pairs, tostring, tonumber, table,
string, math, unpack, type, error, io, os, _VERSION, _G</span>
</p>
<p>
sider adds:<br />
<span class="func">log, memory, fs, zlib, audio, match, input, _FILE</span>
</p>

<p>You can also enable <span class="func">ffi</span> and <span class="func">bit</span> modules, which are LuaJIT
extensions. By default, they are disabled. To enable, modify your
<span class="file">sider.ini</span> like this:</p>

<pre>
luajit.ext.enabled = 1
</pre>

<p>By the way, your module can "investigate" and find out what exactly
is available for it to use - this is not hard, and is left as an
exercise for the reader ;-) Or... you can cheat, and look at <span class="file">env.lua</span>
module.</p>

<a name="input">
<h3>7. Input library</h3>
</a>

<p>The "input" library provides utility methods for managing input from
keyboard and gamepads to the game. It is sometimes useful to restrict (block) such input
when sider overlay is on, so that sider keyboard or gamepad controls do not also result
in game actions. For example, you have logic in your overlay that uses arrow and "Enter"
keys - to choose some kind of action, but the game also responds to "Enter" key as the
action to activate particular mode.</p>

<p class="func">
input.set_blocked(block_flag, hard_block)
</p>

<p class="desc">This function set the state of input blocking. First parameter
is a boolean indicating whether the input should be blocked or unblocked. The second
parameter (optional) specifies whether a "hard block" should be done.<br />
Return value: <b>nil</b></p>

<p class="gwarn">When the "hard block" mode is activated, the overlay toggle and
module switching are also disabled. This is only rarely needed, for example when
entering text from keyboard, so make sure to use carefully,
otherwise you risk loosing control of your game)</p>

<p class="func">
input.is_blocked()
</p>

<p class="desc">This function returns the current state of input-blocking.
Returns 2 values:
<ol>
<li>true - if input is currently blocked, false - otherwise</li>
<li>true - if "hard block" is also on, false - otherwise</li>
</ol>

<a name="memory">
<h3>8. Memory library</h3>
</a>

<p>The "memory" library provides a set of low-level functions that
may prove useful if you're doing some advanced modding.</p>

<p>For example, you need some game state info that is not available in
sider's context object and isn't communicated through events either.
Or you want to modify some bytes in memory, because you feel really
adventurous.</p>


<p class="warn">
<b>IMPORTANT WARNING:</b><br />
USE THIS LIBRARY WITH CARE AND CAUTION,
AND IF AND ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. REALLY.
THESE ARE POWERFUL TOOLS, BUT THERE ARE ALSO DANGEROUS, BECAUSE

<p class="desc">This function writes the string of bytes (str) at the address (addr).
Return value: <span class="file">nil</span></p>

<p class="func">
memory.guard(addr, len, fmt, default_value)
</p>

<p class="desc">This function first checks if the address "addr" contains the value
that matches the default_value given. (It automatically unpacks
the byte sequence of length "len", using the format "fmt".)
If the value checked does not match the "default_value", an error
is raised.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the function returns a new object (table), which has
the "read" and "write" methods that can be used to read and

or <span class="file">nil</span>, if the string was not found.</p>

<p class="func">
memory.safe_search(str, start_addr, end_addr)
</p>

<p class="desc">This function also searches for the string of bytes (str), in the range
of memory addresses between start_addr and end_addr. However, unlike <b>memory.search</b>,
which expects the entire range to be valid, this function checks if the memory pages it
is about to access are allocated and available to the game process. Because of that, it is
slower than memory.search, but it is very safe, as it skips past unavailable areas of RAM and
guard pages and continues on.</p>
Return value: address, at which the string of bytes was found

<p class="func">
memory.pack(format, number)

<p class="desc">This function converts a string of bytes (str) into a Lua number, using
the format parameter to interpret the binary spec. The same values are
supported for "format" param as in memory.pack function.
Return value: a Lua number, converted from binary representation</p>

<p>These last two functions (memory.pack/memory.unpack) are useful, when
used together with memory.read and memory.write, when you need to read
and modify values in RAM and you know what binary formats are used for
those values. See <span class="file">modules/memtest.lua</span> - as the example module that

<h3>11. Audio library</h3>
</a>

<p>This library provides support for playing music and sound effects, which exist completely
outside of the game files. Sounds are not loaded to replace existing ones, but instead you
can load audio of any length and play it at any time, at any volume, using all the information
and events that Sider scripting engine provides.
Audio formats supported are: <span class="auf">WAVE</span>, <span class="auf">MP3</span> and <span class="auf">FLAC</span>.
Simple effects, such as <b>fade-in</b> and <b>fade-out</b>
are supported, as well as a way to <b>change volume</b> and <b>pause/resume</b> a playing sound.
See examples further down on how to accomplish these things, and also consult
<span class="file">audiodemo.lua</span> example module.</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i> = audio.new(filename)</p>

<p class="desc">This function creates a new sound object and returns it as a value of Lua type "userdata".
The filename parameter must contain the full pathname to the sound file. All subsequent operations are done
on this sound object. Let's see some of them.</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i>:play()</p>

<p class="desc">Start playing the sound. Notice that we use of the ":" symbol, which is a usual way
that methods on objects are called in Lua. The "play" method will return immediately, regardless of how long the
duration of the sound is. It will continue playing in the background, until it finishes, or is stopped,
paused, faded-out at a later time.</p>

<p>Here is the simplest example of how to play a sound effect:
<pre>
local s = audio.new("c:\\my-sounds\\ping.wav")
s:play()
</pre>

<p class="gwarn">IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to implementation details of the audio library, you cannot create sound objects in the
module's "init" function. If you try that, the "init" function will just hang and never return, blocking
the game from even starting. Creating sound objects in all other event handler functions is totally fine.</p>

<p class="note"><b>Sound object lifetime</b><br /><br />
If you play a short sound effect and do not need to do anything with it afterwards, then using a local
variable - like in the code above - is fine. However, if you want to affect the play later on, for example: change
its volume, or pause it, fade out/fade back in, then you need to store the sound object in a non-local variable. You can do
that using a module-level variable, or store sound object a non-local table. We will see an example of doing that
in the next code snippet below.</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i>:set_volume(volume)</p>

<p class="desc">Sets the volume for the sound. The "volume" parameter is a float in the ranging from 0.0 (no sound)
to 1.0 (full volume). If you call this on an object that is already playing, the volume will change immediately.</p>

<p><b>Example module: audio1.lua</b>
<pre>
local m = {}

-- place where we keep our sound files
local content_root = ".\\content\\audio-demo\\"

-- module-level variable to keep reference to our sound object
local s

function m.set_stadium_choice(ctx, stadium_choice)
    s = audio.new(content_root .. "sample.wav")
    s:set_volume(0.8)
    s:play()
end

function m.init(ctx)
    -- make content_root and absolute path,
    -- now that sider_dir is available in the context
    content_root = ctx.sider_dir .. content_root

    -- register event handlers
    ctx.register("set_stadium_choice", m.set_stadium_choice)
end

return m
</pre>
</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i>:get_volume()</p>

<p class="desc">Returns the current volume of the sound object, as a float in the range of [0.0, 1.0]</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i>:get_filename()</p>

<p class="desc">Returns the full filename of the sound file that was given when the sound object was created</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i>:get_state()</p>

<p class="desc">Returns the string description of the current state of the sound object. Possible values are:
<ul>
    <li>created</li>
    <li>playing</li>
    <li>fading</li>
    <li>pausing</li>
    <li>paused</li>
    <li>finished</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i>:pause()</p>

<p class="desc">Pauses a playing sound. You can resume it again by calling <span class="func"><i>obj</i>:play()</span> again.
If the fade-out effect has been set (with a call to <span class="func">fade_to</span> method before <span class="func">pause</span>),
then the sound will be paused after the volume fading finishes.
</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i>:finish()</p>

<p class="desc">Stops a playing sound. There is no way to resume it. If you want to play the same sound again, then you
need to create a new sound object with <span class="func">audio.new(filename)</span>.
If the fade-out effect has been set (with a call to <span class="func">fade_to</span> method before <span class="func">finish</span>),
then the sound will be stopped after the volume fading finishes.</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i>:fade_to(volume, in_seconds)</p>

<p class="desc">Fade the volume from the current level to the level specified by "volume" parameter, over the time period specified
by "in_seconds" parameter. Note that fading starts immediately only if the sound is already playing. If the sound hasn't been started
yet or is currently paused, then the fading will begin after <span class="func">play</span> method is called.
<ul>
<li>volume: target volume in the range of [0.0, 1.0]</li>
<li>in_seconds: how long to do the volume fading for. You can specify fractions of a second here too - for example, 2.5 is perfectly fine.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="func"><i>obj</i>:when_done(func)</p>

<p class="desc">This method allows to run some code - a function specified by "func" parameter -
immediately after the sound finishes playing, either because of playing out in its entirety or due to being stopped by
a call to <span class="func">finish</span> method. This allows for things like playing a sequence of multiple sounds,
following one another, or just in general running any logic that needs to be done after a sound finishes playing.</p>

<p>Now let's see some examples of fade-in/fade-out effects. We will create a module that plays one sound, when user
presses "[5]" button, then cross-fades another sound, when user presses "[6]" button.</p>

<p><b>Example: audio2.lua</b>

<pre>
local m = {}

local sound
local sound2

function m.key_up(ctx, vkey)
    if vkey == 0x35 then
        sound = audio.new(ctx.sider_dir .. "content\\audio-demo\\uefa.mp3")
        sound:play()

    elseif vkey == 0x36 then
        -- do a cross-fade from one sound to another
        sound:fade_to(0, 3.5) -- fade-out in 3.5 seconds
        sound:finish()

        sound2 = audio.new(ctx.sider_dir .. "content\\audio-demo\\sample.wav")
        sound2:set_volume(0)   -- start from 0 volume
        sound2:fade_to(1, 2.5) -- fade in in 2.5 seconds
        sound2:play()
    end
end

function m.overlay_on(ctx)
    return "press [5] - to play music, [6] - to crossfade to another sound"
end

function m.init(ctx)
    ctx.register("key_up", m.key_up)
    ctx.register("overlay_on", m.overlay_on)
end

return m
</pre>
</p>

<p>Another, a little longer example: let's start some music, when user presses ["5"] button. During a match, if we press Start button
to pause the game, let's have the music fade out. Then when the user resumes the game, fade the music back in.</p>

<p><b>Example: audio3.lua</b>
<pre>
local m = {}

local sound
local volume

local function pause_sound()
    if sound then
        -- remember volume of this sound, so that we can resume playback later at the same volume
        volume = sound:get_volume()
        -- pause with 2.5 second fade-out
        sound:fade_to(0, 2.5)
        sound:pause()
    end
end

local function resume_sound()
    if sound then
        -- resume play with 2.5 second fade-in
        sound:fade_to(volume, 2.5)
        sound:play()
    end
end

function m.data_ready(ctx, filename)
    if filename == "common\\script\\flow\\Match\\MatchPrePause.json" then
        log("game loaded: " .. filename)
        -- pause sound when Pause Menu shows up
        pause_sound()

    elseif filename == "common\\script\\flow\\Match\\MatchPostPause.json" then
        log("game loaded: " .. filename)
        -- resume sound, when Pause Menu exits
        resume_sound()

    end
end

function m.key_up(ctx, vkey)
    if vkey == 0x35 then
        if sound then
            -- already playing. Let's stop it
            sound:finish()
        else
            -- not playing: Let's start a new sound
            sound = audio.new(ctx.sider_dir .. "content\\audio-demo\\uefa.mp3")
            sound:set_volume(0.7)
            sound:when_done(function(ctx)
                -- we are finished playing: set sound non-local var back to nil
                sound = nil
            end)
            sound:play()
        end
    end
end

function m.overlay_on(ctx)
    return "press [5] to play music"
end

function m.init(ctx)
    ctx.register("livecpk_data_ready", m.data_ready)
    ctx.register("key_up", m.key_up)
    ctx.register("overlay_on", m.overlay_on)
end

return m
</pre>
</p>

<p>Let's see an example of 3-sound sequence:</p>

<p><b>Example: audio4.lua</b>:

<pre>
local m = {}

-- we will keep references to sound objects in this table
local sounds = {}

function m.key_up(ctx, vkey)

One last example is a sort of a fun one. It plays Cristiano Ronaldo's "suuu!" shout, when he scores a goal.
The sound effect is triggered, when the game loads a specific animation file. The MP3 file has 5 seconds of silence,
followed by the shout. It is not perfect in terms of syncing animation and sound, but it works pretty well
most of the times. Just another demonstration of what the audio library can do for you, when used together
with the rest of the Sider's Lua scripting engine.</p>
